# Roadblocks
Inspired by LupusX on Reddit, I have brought the path's to 1.7.10, instead of been another decorative block mod with no real purpose, I have added the option for a speed boost when you walk on them. This is controlled by the speed potion effect and can be changed (even disabled) in the config options!
